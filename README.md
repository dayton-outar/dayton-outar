### Yow! Wah Gwaan?

I've worked on a over 20 projects using several programming languages and frameworks mostly web and multi-media applications. I have yet to build a mobile application and a game. I maybe onto achieving that very soon.

I'm about to study and build a system that uses the web camera to give instruction to a game or an artistic illustration. It should offer a learning experience to master the DOM by using JavaScript and CSS. Tools to recognize gestures and objects will have to be considered for the processing engine of this project.
